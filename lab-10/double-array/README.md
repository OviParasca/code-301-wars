Problem Domain -
Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.

Solution -
We used the array.map() higher-order function to multiply each value by 2, and then to return a new array of double values.
