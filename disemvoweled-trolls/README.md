Problem Domain -
Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

Solution -
From the start i knew the best solution for this codewar was to user RegEx. This is similar to a previous codewar so i was able to use that same idea but use the required format for this codewar.
