Problem Domain -
Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

Solution -
I used regular expression to solve the answer. Either that or a loop but that did not seem as efficient as regEx.
